Annotations are done in the images (60 images) with Age Related Macular Degeneration and related anomalies (Drusen & CNVM) . The label maps created are in correspondence to the anomalies in the images.  
The label maps are used in spatial attention, i.e., the proposed GAN synthesizes AMD images with specific anomoly. The anomaly specific learning is conditioned in the spatial attention maps in the generator model.
The block diagram can be inferred in the manuscript post-publication.
